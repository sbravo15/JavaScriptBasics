These are the reasons I would choose one over the other:


### For-loop Syntax:
```
for( int i = 0; i > 10; i++)
{
    //Some code here
}
```
I would use a for loop for the reason that I may `KNOW the NUMBER OF ITERATIONS` I need to do and I have an INCREMENTING variable which can be handy sometimes.



### While-loop Syntax:
```
while(!done)
{
    //Some code goes here
}
```
I would use this loop when I am `NOT SURE how many ITERATIONS` I might need to carry out. 

- Examples: Waiting for user to input correct input values and keep looping until he/she inputs the proper value.




### Do-While loop Syntax:
```
do
{
    //Some code here
}
while(!done);
```
This loop is almost the same as a while-loop but I would prefer this when I need something done `ATLEAST ONCE` before I start verifying whatever it is that would make me wanna loop and do that code again.

- Example: ask a user for an input for the first time and then validate it. If wrong input given then loop back and ask for input again
